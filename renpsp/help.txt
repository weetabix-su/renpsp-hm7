Hi. I'm Lurkmore-kun.

I will tell you about RenPSP engine.

First of all, controls:

During the game:
  Square      — toggle displaying text
  Cross       — go to the next dialogue line
  L/R         - see game history

At any moment:
  Start       — toggle falling menu
  Arrows      — change active menu item
  Cross       — select a menu item
  Triangle    — make a PNG screenshot

At this help:
  Arrows, L/R - change help page
  Select      - return to the game

----

Windows version of RenPSP is based on LuaPlayer 0.20.

It emulates PSP's keys with keyboard this way:

  q - L
  w - R

  a - Select
  s - Start

  r - Triangle
  d - Square
  f - Circle
  c - Cross

  Arrors - Arrows

----

Engine was written in Lua language for LuaPlayer platform. So, it's not a full RenPy port, but it's imitation.

Lua-code checks /games/ folder for loadable scripts. If two or more contains label 'start', menu is shown to select shich game to load. Engine's state can be saved to 'saves/default.sav', this file is not encrypted. Screenshot is saved to 'screenshot.png'.

Engine supports simple narration, code branching with menus and conditions, character emotions change, label jumping. There is no transition effects.

Code lines and conditions are supported, but they must be written in Lua, not Python as is original RenPy. Main difference for simple games is using "A~=B" instead of "A!=B".

Supported RenPy semantics of:
  define CHARACTER_ID = Character('FULL_NAME')
  image SPRITE_ID [SPRITE_SUBID] = FILENAME
  scene SPRITE_ID
  show SPRITE_ID [SPRITE_SUBID] [at POSITION]
  hide SPRITE_ID
  label LABEL_ID:
  jump LABEL_ID
  play [sound|music] FILENAME
  stop [sound|music]
  $ LuaCode()
  if LuaCode(): elif Lua()Code: else:
  menu:
  return

Those lines are ignored:
  # ... , with ... , pass

Anything else is parsed to lexems, first of them is converted to sayer's name.

----

Set of supported images format is unknown. However, engine does not support image higher then 800õ600 for sure. Included demos use JPEG and 8-bit PNG.

Monotype font Lucida Console is used for text rendering. Text is rendered character by character. Encoding used is CP-1251.

All characters from english and russian keyboard layouts are supported:
qwertyuiop[]\ asdfghjkl;' zxcvbnm,./ `
QWERTYUIOP{}| ASDFGHJKL:" ZXCVBNM<>? ~
éöóêåíãøùçõú\ ôûâàïðîëäæý ÿ÷ñìèòüáþ. ¸
ÉÖÓÊÅÍÃØÙÇÕÚ/ ÔÛÂÀÏÐÎËÄÆÝ ß×ÑÌÈÒÜÁÞ, ¨
1234567890-= !@#$%^&*()_+ !"¹;%:?*()_+

There are also some additional characters for better typoghaphics: « » — ©
